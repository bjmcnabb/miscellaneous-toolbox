# miscellaneous-toolbox

Assortment of convenience functions for handling different tasks. Scripts include the following:

1. bin1d.py - Takes either 1-D or 2-D data and bins it along the column axis. Dependencies include numpy and pandas.

2. dilution_calculations.py - functions for simple dilution chemistry, namely to calculate the volumes or concentrations required/yielded to dilute a solution (using C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>=C<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>), and to generate a dilution series for running a standard curve.

3. std_curve - set of functions to regress/plot a standard curve, and generate a function to compute concentrations given subsequent sample measurements(s).
